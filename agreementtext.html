		<b style="font-size: 24px">Information regarding the research study: “Teaching robots via the web.”</b>

		</br>
		</br>
		<b>Introduction</b></br>
		You are being invited to take part in this research study because you are a user of reddit.com and you have clicked to find out more about this research study.   This study is being conducted by Dr. Josh Bongard in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Vermont. 
		</br></br>
		<b>Purpose</b> </br>
		We are interested in learning more about how people teach robots via the web.
		</br></br>
		<b>Study Procedures</b></br>
		If you take part in the study, you will be presented with a live video feed of robots attempting to obey user-generated commands. You will be asked to type commands in the chat window and to give feedback to the robot. You are free to spend as much or as little time as you like on the site.
		</br></br>
		<b>Benefits</b> </br>
		There will probably be no direct benefit for you to participate; however, information from this study will help us learn more about teaching robots via the web.
		</br></br>
		<b>Risks</b></br>
		We do not anticipate any significant risks. We will collect all data typed into the chat window (including your Twitch user name) for research purposes, but we will not collect any information that will identify you other than your twitch username. 
		</br></br>
		<b>Costs and Compensation</b></br>
		There will be no costs to you for participation in this research study, and you will not be paid for taking part in this study.
		</br></br>
		<b>Confidentiality</b></br>
		All information collected about you during the course of this study will be stored without any identifiers other than your twitch username. We ask that you not enter any identifying information into the chat window. No one will be able to match you to your answers.
		</br></br>
		<b>Voluntary Participation/Withdrawal</b></br>
		Taking part in this study is voluntary.  You are free to withdraw at any time.   You may choose not to take part in this study, or if you decide to take part, you can change your mind later and withdraw from the study. 
		</br></br>
